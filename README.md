# decision-tree-nbi

This project is a part of the Bridging Big Data Group and SMARTI at University of Nebraska, Omaha. 

Project Status

# Description
The purpose of this project is develop prediction model to identify future bridge deterioration and maintenance using the existing National Bridge Inventory (NBI) dataset.

## Partners
* University of Nebraska at Omaha
* University of Nebraska at Lincoln
* Nebraska Department of Transportation

## Methods
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
    - Decision Tree
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

## Technologies
* Python
* MongoDB

# Project Description
The project contains several models which are broadly specified under two categories:
1. Deterioration models
    In general, deterioration models predict the future deterioration of bridge conditions.

2. Maintenance models
    In general, maintenance model predict the future maintenance of bridge conditions. There are three main components for which maintenance models can make predicitons:
        1. Substructure
        2. Superstructure
