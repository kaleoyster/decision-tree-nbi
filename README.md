ðŸŒ‰  Predicting Bridge Maintenance Using Decision Trees  ðŸŒŸ
</h1>

The repository is implementation of prediction models to identify future bridge deterioration and maintenance using the existing National Bridge Inventory (NBI) dataset. This project is a part of the Bridging Big Data Group and SMARTI at University of Nebraska, Omaha.

### ðŸŽ¯ Background
- Bridges are critical infrastructure whose maintenance is a key responsibility for both government and private organizations. 
- Costly to build and repair, bridges are valuable assets that can benefit from improved predictive maintenance.
- In this work, we present a novel, straightforward, non-parametric method for doing predicting future maintenance and identifying influential factors to predict future maintenances of the bridges.

### ðŸ’ª Challenge
- In the NBI dataset, it is a **challenge** to identify maintenance patterns. Because, the `reconstruction_year` does not provide an valuable information about the type of repair or reconstruction done.
- Moreover, for every bridge time-line, the improvement in the condition ratings often does not map with the data in `reconstruction_year`.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- The objective of this research study is to develop a methodology for computing bridge maintenance frequency and based on existing timelines of the available data predict future time-line by accounting for improvement in the condition ratings.

### ðŸ§ª Solution
- To address this challenge we can use bridge intervention matrix, that utilizes the bridge intervention matrix for `deck` to identify various types of intervention depending on the probability of the transition.

- The project contains several models which are broadly specified under two categories:
    * **Deterioration models:** In general, deterioration models predict the future deterioration of bridge conditions.
    * **Maintenance models:** In general, maintenance model predict the future maintenance of bridge conditions. There are three main components for which maintenance models can make predicitons:
        1. Substructure
        2. Superstructure
        3. Deck
