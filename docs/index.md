# Predictive modeling using decision tree

This repository contains code for the Decision Tree Model for the prediction the future condition and maintainance of the bridges. The implementation of this machine learning model is based on the bridge data submitted annually to Federal Highway Agency (FHWA) by the States, Federal agencies, and Tribal governments.

## Core documentation types

The documentation is categorized into three documentation types:

**Concept**:
The concept documentation describes how and why the data processing or decision tree models works.

**Task**:
The task documentation provides specific instruction to execute to run specific models. Tasks tend to have a specific goal and consist of a set of numbered steps that the reader can follow to achieve that goal.

**Reference**:
Contains structured information or specifications that users need to make a script work.
Reference material is provided for fact-checking. The reference sections attempt at comprehensively cataloging data such as functions and their parameters, return codes and error messages. They are often presented as tables, bulleted lists, or sample scripts.
